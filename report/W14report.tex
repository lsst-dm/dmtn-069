    a reference {\tt G0V}, and a ``red'' {\tt M2.0V} star, along with
    a QSO at redshift $z=0$ and $z=0.5$ -- filtered through 3
    transmission profiles corresponding to the LSST $g$, $r$, and
    $i$--bands.  The top row shows the input spectral energy
    distribution $f_\nu(\lambda)$, while the leftmost column shows the
    LSST filter transmission profile in units of the normalized
    system response $\phi$.  The inner row,column figures show the
    effective spectrum of each SED (along columns) when multiplied
    through the respective filter (along rows).  In all subpanels, the
    x--axis is wavelength.  The {\tt A0V}, {\tt G0V}, and {\tt M2.0V}

  \caption{{\bf Designed Orientation of Dcr in W14 Phosim Runs}: This
    figure represents the anticipated orientations of Dcr in the W14
    phoSim data.  The x,y coordinate system is depicted, as well as
    the convention that angles ({\tt rotTelPos}, {\tt rotSkyPos}) are
    clockwise with respect to the positive y--axis in the image
    coordinate system (counterclockwise in the camera coordinate
    system).  The {\tt rotTelPos} of 251 degrees specified for all
    simulations, which reflects the direction to the pole, is shown
    with the red vector \P and the red arc at y=0.6.  The derived {\tt
      rotSkyPos} for visits \A,\B,\D,\E\ are shown with the blue
    vectors, and reflect the angle towards zenith (the angle of
    increasing altitude).  Dcr is expected to happen along these
    vectors.  The angles \P\A,\P\E\ are similar, and represented by
    the green arcs; the angles \P\B,\P\D\ are also similar, and
    represented by the purple arcs.  This is expected as observations
    \A\ and \E\ are taken at airmass 1.55 (zenith distance of 50
    degrees) but at opposite sides of the meridian crossing of the
    star field; a similar situation was designed for observations
    \B\ and \D, which are taken at airmass 1.15 (zenith distance of 30
    degrees).  Visit \C\ is not depicted as it was taken at zenith.

    \caption{{\bf Wcs-Derived Orientations of Phosim Data}: These
      figures show the orientations of the Right Ascension and
      Declination axes (red), and Altitude and Azimuth axes (blue) of
      visits \A,\B,\D,\E.  Arrows represent the directions of {\it
        increasing} coordinate value.  The Ra,Decl axes are the same
      in all images since they were designed to have a common {\tt
        rotTelPos}.  Ideally, the directions of increasing Alt will
      correspond to the {\tt rotSkyPos} depicted in
      Figure~\ref{fig:phosimdcr}.  All coordinate system orientations
      were derived from the fitted Wcs of the {\tt calexp} of the
      $g$--band observation of seeing values {\tt 2}, i.e. the worst seeing
      image.  To determine the orientations empirically, small steps
      were taken in each coordinate starting at the center of the
      image, and the {\tt Wcs} and topocentric corrections used to map
      these back into offsets in the pixel plane.  This figure was
      created using the script {\tt python/compareDcrFromSims.py.py}.}

  \caption{{\bf Differential Chromatic Refraction and Difference Image
      Quality, $g$--band}: This set of panels demonstrates the amount
    of refraction (top row), differential refraction with respect to
    the {\tt G0V} star (middle row), and the quality of the difference
    image (bottom row) for three sets of image differences.  The first
    column uses science visit \A, the middle \C, and the third \E.  In
    all cases the template used was taken at zenith, i.e. visit \C.
    The top rows effectively present the same information as
    Figure~\ref{fig:refractim}, but zoomed in on a particular cluster
    of stars.  The second row subtracts off the green vector from all
    vectors.  The residual refraction of the blue,red vectors
    represents differential chromatic refraction.  These residual
    lengths have been multiplied by a factor of 100 for readability.
    Note that the blue vectors point along the vector to zenith,
    indicating the blue stars appear higher in the sky than their
    green counterparts, compared to an unrefracted observation.  The
    red stars are not refracted as much and thus will appear lower in
    the sky.  On the bottom row, we show the realized difference image
    quality.  Note that the blue stars have positive lobes pointing
    along the direction to zenith, meaning the stars are ``higher'' in
    the sky w.r.t. the green stars when compared to the zenith
    template, while the dipoles of the red stars have the opposite
    polarity.  For completeness, the Wcs--derived orientation of the
    Ra,Decl and Az,Alt coordinate axes are shown in the difference
    image (Ra,Decl,Az,Alt are magenta,yellow,green,cyan); see
    Figure~\ref{fig:wcsdcr} for more detail.  This figure was created

  \caption{{\bf Number of False Positives, Postfiltering}: This figure
    shows the median number of false positives across the 9 {\tt
      raft=2,2} CCDs.  The first row of information shows these
    ``heat-maps'' for $g$--band data, the second for $r$--band, and
    the third for $i$--band.  The first column represents the
    good--seeing images, the second the medium--seeing images (same
    quality as template), and the third the poor-seeing images.
    Within each filter--seeing combination, the heat--map represents
    the median number of false positives as a function of the template
    airmass (visit \A\B\C\D\E) along the x--axis, and image airmass
    (visit \A\B\C\D\E) along the y--axis.  The diagonal elements
    represent the situation where the template and science image are
    taken at the same airmass and have the same orientation
    w.r.t. zenith.  The off--diagonal elements represent a mismatch
    between the template and science image in terms of airmass {\it
      and} parallactic angle.  The general trend is that the numbers
    of false positives decrease with decreasing differences in the
    airmass,angle attributes of the template and science image,
    decrease with increasing seeing, and decrease with increasing
    wavelength.  The $i$-band data in poor seeing do not appear
    sensitive to Dcr.  This figure was created using the script {\tt

  phoSim visit \A\B\C\D\E.  Observations were designed to follow a
  single star field through zenith on a single night, and observed
  twice before and twice after crossing the meridian, as well as at
  zenith.  Each visit was simulated using the same random seed
  (153555399), in 3 filters ($g$, $r$, $i$), and under 4 observing
  conditions.  These correspond to the template image ({\tt
    Opsim\_rawseeing} = 0.878'' and {\tt SIM\_VISTIME} = 300) and then
  3 bins in seeing for the science image corresponding to {\tt
    Opsim\_rawseeing} = 0.6'', 0.878'', and 1.2'' for seeing bins {\tt
    1,2,3}, respectively.  All science images were simulated with {\tt

  Overall, this yielded $5 \times 3 \times 4 = 60$ runs of phoSim,

  {\tt 0} for the template and {\tt 123} for the science

  of the {\it positive} lobe of any dipole arising from the Dcr
  effect.  Numbers are reported as a function of visit \A--\E, and the
  spectral energy distribution of the source.  For the {\tt rotTelPos}
  and {\tt Wcs} columns, the numbers for the red {\tt M2.0V} stars are
  simply $180^{\circ}$ from those of the blue {\tt A0V} stars, which
  should be in the direction of zenith.  The numbers under {\tt

  to phoSim.  The numbers under {\tt Wcs} reflect the empirically
  determined direction to zenith in each image, using the {\tt calexp}
  fitted {\tt Wcs} and topocentric corrections appropriate for each
  visit.  Finally, we report the measured median orientation of
  DiaSources in each image difference, when differenced against the
  template taken at zenith (visit \C).  Here the red and blue
  populations are considered separately.  \\ ~ \\ These numbers come
  from analysis of $g$--band data, seeing bin {\tt 1}, which have the
  most dipoles.  We only show results for 1 filter since the
  orientation should be filter--independent.  Results in the
  $r$--band, in cases where there are more than 10 dipoles measured,
  show quantitatively similar results.  In addition, we only report
  numbers from the postfiltered data, where dipole measurement is
  known to operate correctly.  We do not see any dependence of these

  define the astrometric reference system in this study.  The Theory
